"6034104","TabHost / TabWidget - Scale Background Image?","<p>I need to scale my TabWidget background images so they maintain aspect ratio.<br>
I am using a TabHost with a TabWidget.  I am then using setBackgroundDrawable to set the images.</p>

<p>I found a close answer here - <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2409521/background-in-tab-widget-ignore-scaling/4462802#4462802"">Background in tab widget ignore scaling</a>.  However, I'm not sure just where to add the new Drawable code.  (Working with the HelloTabWidget example, none of my modules use RelativeLayout, and I don't see any layout for ""tabcontent"".)</p>

<p>I also found this thread - <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1400782/android-scale-a-drawable-or-background-image"">Android: Scale a Drawable or background image?</a>.  According to it, it sounds like I would have to pre-scale my images, which defeats the whole purpose of making them scaleable.</p>

<p>I also found another thread where someone subclassed the Drawable class so it would either not scale, or it would scale properly.  I can't find it now, but that seems like a LOT to go through when you should just be able to do something simple like mTab.setScaleType(centerInside).</p>

<p>Here's my code:</p>

"6034105","Java ImageIO: Exception Weirdness","<p>In my application I was trying to save a <code>BufferedImage</code> to a PNG file using <code>ImageIO</code>. The file is chosen by the user so I need to react to errors that might happend (e.g. user tries to save in a location he has no write permission for). However I am unable to catch the <code>IOException</code> that occurs.</p>

<p>The following code shows the problem. Trying to save to ""/foo"" should throw an exception for most users on *nix systems, since they do not have write permission in the root directory.</p>

<pre><code>import java.awt.image.BufferedImage;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BufferedImage img = new BufferedImage(640, 480,
                BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_RGB);
        try {
            File f = new File(""/foo"");
            ImageIO.write(img, ""png"", f);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println(""Caught IOException!"");
        }

<p>Note that <code>FileNotFoundException</code> is a subclass of <code>IOException</code> so it should get caught. A second catch block did not help either: </p>

Console.WriteLine(a.ToString()); // displays 2

<p>Now, here are some of my understandings:</p>

<ol>
<li>All the classes in .net get a <code>ToString()</code> method, which is inherited from the <code>Object</code> class.</li>
<li>A structure cannot be derived from a Class or another struct. <code>int</code> is a structure of type <code>Int32</code>, which  gets a couple of <code>ToString()</code> [With Parameters] methods from the Interfaces which it implements.</li>
<li>There is also a <code>ToString()</code> [without params] function in struct <code>Int32</code></li>
</ol>

<p>According to <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.int32.tostring.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.int32.tostring.aspx</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>struct Int32 overrides ValueType.ToString() method</p>

<p>If a struct cannot inherit some class or struct, can you please explain how this <code>ToString()</code> method is available for <code>Int32</code>?</p>

"6034109","C# socket message decompression","<p>i am new to the C# world. I am using it for fast deployment of a solution to capture a live feed which comes in this form (curly brackets for clarity): {abcde}{CompressedMessage}, where {abcde} constitutes 5 characters indicating the length of the compressed message. The CompressedMessage is compressed using XCeedZip.dll, and needs to be uncompressed using the dll's uncompress method. The uncompress method returns an integer value indicating success or failure (of various sorts, eg no license failure, uncompression failure etc). I am receiving failure 1003 <a href=""http://doc.xceedsoft.com/products/XceedZip/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.xceedsoft.com/products/XceedZip/</a> for reference of the return values from the uncompress method.</p>

<pre><code>while(true){    
byte[] receiveByte = new byte[1000];
sock.Receive(receiveByte);
string strData =System.Text.Encoding.ASCII.GetString(receiveByte,0,receiveByte.Length);
string cMesLen = strData.Substring(0,5); // length of compressed message;
string compressedMessageStr = strData.Substring(5,strData.Length-5);
byte[] compressedBytes = System.Text.Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(compressedMessageStr);
//instantiating xceedcompression object     
XceedZipLib.XceedCompression obXCC = new XceedZipLib.XceedCompression();
obXCC.License(""blah"");
// uncompress method reference http://doc.xceedsoft.com/products/XceedZip/
// visual studio displays Uncompress method signature as Uncompress(ref object vaSource, out object vaUncompressed, bool bEndOfData)

object oSource = (object)compressedBytes;
int status = (int) obXCC.Uncompress(ref oSource, out oDest, true);

<p>So basically my question boils down to invocation of the uncompress method and correct way of passing the parameters. I am in unfamiliar territory in the .net world, so i won't be surprised if the question is really simplistic.</p>

<p>Here's my problem. Two users have a speed variable, based on who has the faster speed is who hits the most, and first. So here are some imaginary stats:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>UserA has 2,000 speed</p>
  
  <p>UserB has 4,000 speed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>UserB has 2x the amount of speed, thus would hit first, and would get two hits before UserA gets a shot, so the battle would go as follows:</p>

<pre><code>UserB hits UserA
UserB hits UserA
***UserA hits UserB
UserB hits UserA
UserB hits UserA
***UserA hits UserB
</code></pre>

<p>In that pattern. The concept itself is simple, but I'm having big problems with the execution. I need to loop this so I can do the damage calculations and insert battle events into the database, but how can I - within the loop - tell php who gets to hit this round and how many more hits they get, and so on? </p>

The method <code>[MFMessageComposeViewController canSendText]</code> returns <code>YES</code> even on iPad.
I don't know why. It was OK when I tested about 2 month ago.</p>

<p>The iOS version is 5.1 (9B176) and the device is iPad 2 (new Pad has the problem as well).
The xcode version is 4.3.1</p>

<p>Has anybody met the same problem?</p>

<hr>

<p>@jrturton: Yes, you're right. When I turn iMessage off, <code>[MFMessageComposeViewController canSendText]</code> returns <code>NO</code>.
It seems that <code>[MFMessageComposeViewController canSendText]</code> can NOT be used to find whether the device could send SMS. So how?</p>

<p>...given the chain in the image, how would I go about calculating a chain that defines <em>the same shape</em> but without crossing paths?</p>

<p>Specifically, in the case of the image's input chain, the result I want looks like this:</p>

<p>I'm looking for an algorithm to accomplish this for any chain, but I'm not sure what I'm trying to do is even called, which makes searching for a solution tricky.</p>

Right now we're using a Visual Studio Deployment Project that creates an MSI, but that won't replace/upgrade a Windows service, nor can it start and stop the service for us.</p>

"6034139","Most comprehensive, foolproof way to determine available features in .NET MF 4.1?","<p>I'm just starting to learn the .NET Micro Framework, and coming from C# I have quickly realized (and can certainly understand why) several classes are not available in the MF.  The tricky part for me is actually determining what the available features are.  It would be great if there was a webpage where I could type in something that I want, and it would tell me if it's available, and if not, what the closest match is.</p>

<p>For example, if I wanted a <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code>, maybe it would tell me to use an <code>ArrayList</code>.  Or it would suggest a <code>Hashtable</code> instead of <code>Dictionary</code>.</p>

<p>I usually google, or hope that MSDN will point me in the right direction.  However, today I wanted to use <code>System.Nullable</code>, and it was apparently not available.  I couldn't find an appropriate assembly to add from the Add References dialog.  Google failed me as well, and when I went to check <code>System.Nullable</code> at MSDN, I couldn't find references to the .NET MF anywhere.</p>

<p>So I am basically assuming at this point, that <code>System.Nullable</code> isn't available, but for those trying to do some .NET MF development, is there a better way to quickly ascertain whether or not a particular class is okay to use?</p>

<p>Throughout the CFC the <code>&lt;cftry&gt;</code> catches the error and sends it back to my page. where it gets output to the console.</p>

<p>My question is, why does this particular block of code not work with <code>&lt;cftry&gt;</code> and the error gets sent directly to the exception handling in my Application.CFC?</p>

"6034142","In python, how would I open a PIL or Imagemagick Image as a file","<p>I'm taking uploaded files which I can save to S3 using SimpleS3:</p>

<pre><code>from simples3.bucket import S3Bucket
upload = request.POST['image']
s = S3Bucket(""cdn"", s3.access_key, s3.secret_key)

<p>Somewhere between saving that as a file and uploading it I save the file which is an image as a thumbnail using PIL or Imagemagick depending on what kind of image file was uploaded. The process there is to turn the File into an Image. My question is how do I open that Image as a file? I'm trying to upload the thumbnail to Amazon's S3 exactly as I do above. My code below is the idea of what I'm attempting:</p>

<pre><code>thumb = self._im.copy() #where _im is the Image
s = S3Bucket(""cdn"", s3.access_key, s3.secret_key)
s.put(self.filename+ext, thumb)

<p>I've tried with no success:</p>

<pre><code>f = open(thumb, ""rb"")
s.put(self.filename+ext, f.read()

<p>What does work, but is incredibly inefficient, is writing the file to the drive using the Image.save function and then opening it as a file:</p>

"6034143","Preventing a complete rebuild using branches with GIT and Visual Studio 2005","<p>One of the problem I faced when using branches in GIT was that it was very easy when switching branches to cause visual studio 2005 to cause a complete rebuild of the source because of the time/date being changed when switching branches.</p>

<p>My typical layout is this.<br>
svn/remote<br>
master<br>
test</p>

<p>When switch between either the test and the master branch even though both of them shared exactly the same timestamp on the project. It would cause visual studio 2005 to rebuild the complete project again.</p>

<p>To resolve this issue, my solution was to create another GIT repository but to make a new repository that pulled from the main repository c:/myPrimary 'test' branch. This way, even though both master and test branches had their own folder via the extra repository this resolved having to do a complete recompilation of the source code when switching between the two.</p>

<p>Just checking if anyone else have had this problem and the solution they have come up with resolving it. Please note, a complete recompilation of the source code is in the area of 20 minutes.</p>

"6034149","The ASP.NET MVC Routing Querystring vs Embedded Value Bewilderment","<p>This has probably been asked already - if so sorry! I couldn't find it.
I am unsure as to how asp is able to decide when to use a query string and ""normal looking paths"" (Embedded values)
Take this for example: </p>

<pre><code>routes.MapRoute(

    ""SomePage"",
    ""Net/Fix/{value}"",
    new { controller = ""Net"", action = ""Index"" }
    );

routes.MapRoute(
    ""Default"", // Route name
    ""{controller}/{action}/{id}"", // URL with parameters
    new { controller = ""Home"", action = ""Index"", id = UrlParameter.Optional } // Parameter defaults
);
</code></pre>

<p>I don't know how to explain - I will try.. If I am wrong please explain it </p>

<p>Question 1.
Is the first argument in mapRoute so that we can specify which routing we want to take place when using hyperlinks?</p>

<p>Question 2.
What does the second argument do? 
It appears as if the second argument gives you the option of specifying how the routing should occur as below: ""Net/Fix/hello"" or by specifying placeholders in the form of {controller}/{action}/{somevar}</p>

<p>Question 3: 
I assume if nothing is used in question 2 scenario - this specifies default routing that should take place? </p>

<p>Question 4: 
How does ASP.NET infer whether to use a query string or an embedded value..</p>

<p>Because for example when I decide to call my page </p>

<pre><code>http:/localhost:portno/Net/Fix/hello
</code></pre>

<p>It dutifully prints hello.. but when I do <em>this</em></p>

<pre><code>http:/localhost:portno/Net/Index/hello
</code></pre>

<p>It doesn't work.. unless I do </p>

<pre><code>http:/localhost:portno/Net/Index?value=hello..

"6034151","How to release anonymous delegates / closures correctly in C#?","<p>I'm working on a GUI application, which relies heavily on <code>Action&lt;&gt;</code> delegates to customize behavior of our UI tools. I'm wondering if the way we are doing this has any potential issues, e.g. whether the implementation keeps references to captured variables, class instances that declare the delegates etc? </p>

<p>So let's say we have this class <code>MapControl</code>, which wraps a stateful GUI control. The map has different kinds of tools (Drawing, Selection, etc.), represented by <code>ITool</code> interface. You can set the tool with <code>StartTool()</code>, but you can only have one tool active at a time, so when another tool is set previous one is stopped using <code>StopTool()</code>. When tool is stopped, a caller-specified callback delegate is executed.</p>

<pre><code>public class MapControl
{
    ITool _currentTool;
    Action&lt;IResult&gt; _onComplete;

    public void StartTool(ToolEnum tool, Action&lt;IResult&gt; onComplete) {

        //If tool is active, stop it first
        if (_currentTool != null) StopTool();

        _onComplete = onComplete;

        //Creates a tool class, etc.
        _currentTool = CreateTool(tool) as ITool;
    }

    public void StopTool() {

        //Execute callback delegate
        IResult result = _currentTool.GetResult();
        if (_onComplete != null)
            _onComplete(result);

        //Nix the references to callback and tool
        _onComplete = null;
        _currentTool = null;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the application's <code>ViewModel</code> class we set some tool like this:</p>

<pre><code>class ViewModel
{
    private MapControl _mapControl = new MapControl();
    public void SetSomeTool() 
    {
        //These variables will be captured in the closure
        var someClassResource = this.SomeClassResource;
        var someLocalResource = new object();

        //Start tool, specify callback delegate as lambda
        _mapControl.StartTool(ToolEnum.SelectTool, (IResult result) =&gt; {

            //Do something with result and the captured variables
            someClassResource.DoSomething(result, someLocalResource);
        });
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In our case the <code>ViewModel</code> class is attached to the main window of a WPF application, and there can only be one instance of <code>ViewModel</code> during the application lifetime. Would it change anything if this weren't the case, and the classes which declare the delegates would be more transient?</p>

<p>My question is, am I disposing of the callback delegates correctly? Are there any scenarios, where this can cause memory bloat by holding on to references it shouldn't?</p>

<p>More generally, what's the safe and correct way of disposing anonymous delegates?</p>

The server will keep running even if the applescript is force quit. Is there any way to have it quit automatically, as soon as the server is launched?</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/pmp3u.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I have been messing around for over an hour but just can't see a way to apply actionscript and all the tutorials on the internet seem to target ActionScript 3 or not do exactly what I want.</p>

<p>The reason for this is that there is background music to the site and when YouTube is launched, it needs to be muted. I know the code to mute and have done this on custom objects before, but I can't see any way to apply script to a textbox hyperlink.</p>

<p>Whilst I would ideally like to do it this way, I am happy to consider any solution resulting in opening a page and muting the site.</p>

<p>To be honest, I tried doing a quick switch to AS3, but as there are so many problems that would need addressing, I would rather spend the time converting the site to HTML/Jquery or even Silverlight.... I just hope there is something small I have overlooked which can get this done without too many changes needed.</p>

I'm adding some more info for clarification.</p>

<li>I'm developing the site myself  </li>
<li>The template is 100% custom template  </li>
<li>Based on info from $_GET, I load data from my custom DB table and display this on page  </li>
<li>My site has an avarage of between 3-400 unique visitors per day. At peak I have 2000 unique visitors per day.</li>
<li>I'm developing an online fashion magazine</li>
<li><p>My URL is currently being created like this:  </p>

<p><code>Url = get_permalink().'?bid='.$brand-&gt;id.'&amp;name='.$brand-&gt;name;</code></p></li>
<li><p>I've used similar method here:<br>

</ul>

<p>Using Custom Post Type was an option I considered, but I needed my own table structurem because designers / brands are linked up against galleries (and more links to other tables to come). So saving brands data in WP POST  table was not going to work.</p>

<p>Now I split in excel for many files with ~ 1000 per fail and update database. It takes some time. Can you give me an idea, or maybe I have some error in my code? Update using ajax as I think will not help.</p>

"6034194","Difficulty adding a new view to a Roo-generated project","<p>I'm trying to add my custom view and controller to a VERY basic roo-generated project.</p>

<p>By using Spring Tool Suite (STS, Spring 3.1) I created a new project and then ran the following 3 commands:</p>

<pre><code>    persistence setup --database MYSQL --provider HIBERNATE --userName *** --password *** --databaseName ***
    entity jpa --class com.demoing.domain.Customer --testAutomatically 
    field string --fieldName firstName --notNull 
    field string --fieldName lastName --notNull 
    controller scaffold --class com.demoing.controller.CustomerController --entity com.demoing.domain.Customer
</code></pre>

<p>After generating these, the application can be started on the server.</p>

<p>However, when I add a new .jspx file (Like home.jspx) the application says ""Resource not found"" when going to the specific link. I added to jspx next to other views in src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/views/home.jspx</p>

<p>I've added the view's definition in views.xml and manually created a controller as seen below:</p>

<pre><code>package com.demoing.domain;

import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Scope;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.ui.Model;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;

@Controller
@Scope(value = ""session"")
@RequestMapping(""/home"")
public class HomeController {
    @RequestMapping(produces=""text/html"")
    public String home(HttpServletRequest request, Model uiModel ){

        return ""home"";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the views definition:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;definition name=""home"" extends=""public""&gt;
    &lt;put-attribute name=""body"" value=""/WEB-INF/views/home.jspx"" /&gt;
  &lt;/definition&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>All I want is to display a completely new, empty page. However when I go to ""project/home"" it says ""resource not found"".</p>

<p>I really don't understand what I'm missing and I hope someone with a bit more experience with these things can help me out.</p>
